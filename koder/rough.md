# Family Office CRM

## Overview

- we are tasked to build a solution that will simplify the tasks of an
  investment house
- they have provided an excel sheet (koder/docs/CRM.xlsx)
- they have got some help doing a basic frontend to get an idea
  (koder/docs/demo.html) ; consider this as a juveline attempt and its also
  broken

## Their Request email

This is my email: koder/docs/email.md

## Requirement

- Can you analyse this and suggest me what to build
- Can you review the data and see how to approach it?
- Can you review & see if the data is in a format thats easy for you to do
  analysis; or should I change it to say CSV or so, so that you can build an
  analysis tool to get vital stats?
- From his key needs, what all features would help him directly?
- I am not sure about the platforms he suggested: metal & hubspot? How do we
  enable easy movement of data?
- I wish to make a purely static web app; won't it suffice for the task;
  obviously only as a proof; Its nearly 2MB of data, I think it will easily load
  and the local only system will perform well for search/filtering etc?
- I think the data leans towards a CRM (person oriented) rather than family
  office data, as its looks

## Key Modality of Interaction

- I wish to discuss with you, rather than having to build anything. We will
  first discuss and build a plan on what to build.
- First give me sharp ways to think about what to do
