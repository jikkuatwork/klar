It was a pleasure meeting you last week. Thanks for a great chat. I hope you´ve had a great weekend!

As mentioned on the call, my hard bottleneck are these four steps and I am getting so tired of not having a proper working tool to help me organize my network:

Home Dashboard of the software itself, like the one I showed you on the call (code attached, only this needs to be re-written to a better dashboard).
A proper working database with all the different filtering solutions I showed you (Family Office list attached).
Just a start on the CRM solution, so the list can be obtained from the database and be added directly to a modular pipeline (like Hubspot or Metal (https://www.metal.so/)) that can help us with reachouts and capital raising and in general have a good overview of our network.
Put in place dashboards that show both personal profiles and company profiles, and a "Create Profile" button, which allows us to create these profiles directly on the platform itself, so we don´t need to first add names to an excel file and then upload it to the software.
 

Plese find attached a document with the code to the platform I showed you and a family office excel file with around 6500 names. I am looking forward to see the outcome 😃

Have a great day and week!

Please keep this information and all the files confidential.

Med vennlig hilsen / Best regards,
